# Video Processing with OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV to process a video file in Python. The program reads a video file, removes the green screen, and writes the resulting video to a new file. 

## Getting Started

To use this program, you will need to install OpenCV and NumPy. You can do this by running:

```sh
python3.10 -m pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage

You can run the program by executing the `video_processing.py` file. You will need to pass in the path to the video file you want to process. For example:

```sh
python3.10 main.py
```
